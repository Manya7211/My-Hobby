        <div class="line"></div>
        <p>In my free time, reading books is my favorite thing to do. Reading is my favorite hobby because there are many types of books: fiction, fantasy, nonfiction, chapter books and more. While you read, you learn, even if the books are fictional. While reading, if feels like you're somewhere else. My favorite books are called "The Girl in the Locked Room" and "Deep and Dark and Dangerous", both by Mary Downing Hahn. My favorite book series are called Wings of Fire by Tui T. Sutherland and Amulet by Kazu Kibuishi. Mary and Tui are my favorite authors.</p>
        <p>I like Mary Downing Hahn's books because she writes all kinds of books, but out of them all, her horror books are the best. Out of all of my favorite books and book series, my most favorite one is The Girl in the Locked Room. It's a great read. I like the fact that it has multiple point of views.</p>
