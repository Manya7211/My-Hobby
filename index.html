        <h1>Mary Downing Hahn</h1>
        <div class="line"></div>
        <p>Mary Downing Hahn is the author of The Girl in the Locked Room, Deep and Dark and Dangerous and more. Mary first inspired me to start writing. Because of her, I started writing a book. The best thing about her books is that they don't end in cliffhangers. The endings ahre always satisfying.I have only read her horror books, but she does have books that aren't horror.</p>

        <h1>Tui T. Sutherland</h1>
        <div class="line"></div>
        <p>Tui T. Sutherland is the author of the book series Wings of Fire. Her illustrations (on the book cover) are amazing. She inspired me to start drawing things other than people. The thing I especially like about hre books is that there are a lot of details and that even though she thinks of children and teens as her audience, adults will also enjoy them.</p>
